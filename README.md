# Tychobra Hugo Theme

### Why I made this theme

I was trying to make a website using blogdown, but I kept running into road blocks because I did not have a good understanding of Hugo.  After several days of circular progress, I decided I needed to write a simple theme so I could better understand what Hugo was actually doing.  This theme is the result.  This theme is by no means taking advantage of all of Hugo's capabilities, but if you want a simple theme that still looks ok (IMHO) then feel free to give this one a shot.
